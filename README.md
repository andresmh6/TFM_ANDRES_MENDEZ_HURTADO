TFM - Downstream Functional Analysis of Perseus-Processed Proteomics Data
Overview
This repository is part of the differential interactome analysis performed for my master's final project. It focuses on three Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins: Gas1 and Cwp2, which are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, and Emp24, a cargo receptor involved in their ER export. The analysis identifies proteins that interact specifically or differentially with these three conditions, using label-free quantitative proteomics followed by downstream filtering, comparison, and functional visualization.

Repository Structure
Analysis/
Contains the main RMarkdown script (ANALISISPERSEUS.Rmd) with all the downstream code, including:

Import and cleaning of LFQ data exported from Perseus.
Normalization of intensities (e.g., day 1 correction and anti-log₂ transformation).
Identification of enriched and exclusive interactors.
Overlap analyses (Venn diagrams) between Gas1, Cwp2 and Emp24.
Comparison with physical interactors from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD).
Generation of Cytoscape-compatible output files.
Additionally, this folder should contain the SGD physical interaction files used for comparison:

CWP2_physical_interactions.txt
GAS1_physical_interactions.txt
EMP24_physical_interactions.txt
AMICA files/
Contains the input files required to run AMICA. These include:

The experimental design file.
The contrast file.
The normalized data matrix (perseus.tsv), which must be generated by the user using their own dataset.
This file is not included in the repository, as it contains experimental data.
It should be obtained by processing a Perseus-exported table using the data preparation steps provided in the script located in Analysis/ANALISISPERSEUS.Rmd.
These files must follow the structure and formatting required by AMICA.
Note: some preprocessing steps (such as normalization) are dataset-dependent and should be adapted if using a different experimental design.

How to Use
Prepare your input data
Export your LFQ quantification table from Perseus as .txt.

Edit the script accordingly
In ANALISISPERSEUS.Rmd, update the read.table() line to match your input filename:

datos <- read.table(file = "your_perseus_export.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
Install required R packages The analysis depends on the following R packages:

ggplot2

ggVennDiagram

patchwork

stringr

dplyr

Run the script Open ANALISISPERSEUS.Rmd in RStudio and knit it to HTML or PDF to execute the full workflow. Make sure your working directory is set to the root of the repository so all file paths resolve correctly.
Notes
Input proteomics data is not included in this repository due to publication restrictions.

All results generated by the script (e.g., Venn diagrams, output tables for Cytoscape) will be saved automatically.

For AMICA usage, the folder AMICA files/ provides an example of properly formatted input.
