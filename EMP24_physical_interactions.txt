(2023) PMID:37968396	Protein interactions were identified using statistically significant enrichment of the proteins in the forward and reverse pull-downs, as well as making use of the profile similarities of interacting proteins in a correlation analysis. High confidence interactions have a total score >=2. This score is a sum of the FDR score of the forward pull-down + FDR score of the reverse pull-down + correlation score.
